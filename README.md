# How do I know where the WCAG 2.1's document has changed?

I have the translation of the WCAG 2.0 in Portuguese (pt-PT). Now, June 5, 2018, W3C published the WCAG 2.1 which add some new content to the last version: the WCAG 2.0. **How do I know where the document has changed?**

Well, easy!! Comparing the original HTML format of the WCAG 2.0's document with the new WCAG 2.1's document and get a new document also in HTML with the text added highlighted in yellow and the text deleted marked with strikethrough. And one more thingâ€¦ **the new HTML file has the same structure of the new WCAG 2.1**.

Here it is the file: [/wcag/wcag21.html](wcag21.html)

Now you know what is new and what was deleted. Fork this repo and edit the [wcag21.html](wcag21.html) putting the old text already translated in the new HTML structure and translate the new content. Don't forget to remove completely the elements &lt;span class="rcl-da"&gt; (content added, word by word) and the &lt;span class="rcl-dd"&gt; (content deleted, word by word).

At the end you will have a WCAG 2.1's document completely translated and with the right structure and HTML format to send to W3C/WAI.
